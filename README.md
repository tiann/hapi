# HAPI

Run official Claude Code / Codex / Gemini / OpenCode sessions locally and control them remotely through a Web / PWA / Telegram Mini App.

> **Why HAPI?** HAPI is a local-first alternative to Happy. See [Why Not Happy?](docs/guide/why-hapi.md) for the key differences.

## Features

- **Seamless Handoff** - Work locally, switch to remote when needed, switch back anytime. No context loss, no session restart.
- **Native First** - HAPI wraps your AI agent instead of replacing it. Same terminal, same experience, same muscle memory.
- **AFK Without Stopping** - Step away from your desk? Approve AI requests from your phone with one tap.
- **Your AI, Your Choice** - Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode—different models, one unified workflow.
- **Terminal Anywhere** - Run commands from your phone or browser, directly connected to the working machine.
- **Voice Control** - Talk to your AI agent hands-free using the built-in voice assistant.

## Getting Started

```bash
npx @twsxtd/hapi hub --relay     # start hub with E2E encrypted relay
npx @twsxtd/hapi                 # run claude code
```

`hapi server` remains supported as an alias.

The terminal will display a URL and QR code. Scan the QR code with your phone or open the URL to access.

> The relay uses WireGuard + TLS for end-to-end encryption. Your data is encrypted from your device to your machine.

HAPI means "哈皮" a Chinese transliteration of [Happy](https://github.com/slopus/happy). Great credit to the original project.
