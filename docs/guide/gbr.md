# Build Remote Agent (companion, not a replacement)

**HAPI** is the first-party remote UI (PWA / native) for official coding-agent sessions. **Build Remote Agent** is a different product: a phone that spectates a desktop coding agent through `gbr-agent` (`gbr/1`).

Keep using HAPI hub/relay for HAPI's own remote control. Pair `gbr-agent` on the **coding-agent host** if you want a spectator/veto phone that talks to Bot API `http://127.0.0.1:8788` / `gbr-mcp` instead of the HAPI hub. Do not mix mailbox keys into HAPI config.

## Install + pair

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://grokbuildremote.com/install.sh | bash
gbr-agent version          # must print v0.6.0 or newer
gbr-agent pair             # QR in browser + printed 8-char code
gbr-agent run              # leave running
```

```powershell
# Windows
irm https://grokbuildremote.com/install.ps1 | iex
gbr-agent version
gbr-agent pair
gbr-agent run
```

Phone: open [Build Remote Agent](https://grokbuildremote.com/) → **Scan QR from computer** (or type the 8-char code). Sessions appear in the app. **Unpair** in Settings before changing PCs. Force-close is not enough.

## Attach

After `gbr-agent run`:

| How | Where |
|-----|--------|
| Bot API | `http://127.0.0.1:8788` |
| MCP stdio | `node …/GrokBuildRemote-Agents/mcp/gbr-mcp/bin/gbr-mcp.js` |

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8788/health
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8788/v1/sessions
```

Phone is spectator + veto, not orchestrator. Do not commit mailbox keys. Phone **Settings → Bot API** is the only place a relay key is copied.

MCP clone:
