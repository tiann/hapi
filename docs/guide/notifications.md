# Notifications

Get notified when sessions need input, request permissions, fail, or complete — via native app notifications, Telegram, Server酱 (ServerChan), Web Push, or voice.

Web Push needs no provider configuration: [install the PWA](./pwa.md) and allow notifications. The channels below are optional.

## Native app notifications

For official Android and iOS apps, pair an updated hub and allow notifications.
No Firebase project or Apple developer account is needed. Notification content
is end-to-end encrypted through the official push relay, which also works when
you access the hub through Tailscale or your own HTTPS setup. Android requires
Google Play services and FCM connectivity.

Private app builds can use their own matching Firebase/APNs credentials.
See the [native push contract](../api/native-companion-contract.md) for those
settings and delivery details.

## Telegram Setup

Enable Telegram notifications and Mini App access:

1. Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and create a bot
2. Set the bot token and public URL
3. Start the hub and bind your account

```bash
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your-bot-token"
export HAPI_PUBLIC_URL="https://your-public-url"

hapi hub
```

Then message your bot with `/start`, open the app, and bind using
`CLI_API_TOKEN:<namespace>` (for example, `your-token:default`).

Related environment variables:

- `TELEGRAM_NOTIFICATION` - Enable/disable Telegram notifications (default: `true`)

**Troubleshooting:**

- If binding fails, verify `HAPI_PUBLIC_URL` is accessible from the internet
- Telegram Mini App requires HTTPS (not HTTP)

## ServerChan (Server酱) Setup

Server酱 pushes notifications to WeChat and other channels. The hub sends ServerChan messages when a session is ready for input, requests a permission, a task fails, or a session completes.

1. Get a SendKey from [sct.ftqq.com](https://sct.ftqq.com/)
2. Set the SendKey and start the hub:

```bash
export SERVERCHAN_SENDKEY="your-sendkey"
export HAPI_PUBLIC_URL="https://your-public-url"

hapi hub
```

Messages include a link back to the session, built from `HAPI_PUBLIC_URL`.

Related environment variables:

- `SERVERCHAN_NOTIFICATION` - Enable/disable ServerChan notifications (default: `true`)
- `SERVERCHAN_BACKGROUND_ONLY` - Only send ServerChan notifications when the namespace has no visible HAPI connection (default: `false`)

When `SERVERCHAN_BACKGROUND_ONLY=true`, a visible HAPI connection suppresses ServerChan for the entire namespace. Hidden, disconnected, or closed HAPI pages do not count as visible, so ServerChan can act as a background fallback. This is namespace-wide and does not select a particular device.

These values can also be set in `settings.json` (`serverChanSendKey`, `serverChanNotification`, `serverChanBackgroundOnly`).

## Voice assistant setup

Enable voice control:

1. Get an API key from [elevenlabs.io](https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys)
2. Set the environment variable:

```bash
export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="your-api-key"
hapi hub --relay
```

See [Voice Assistant](./voice-assistant.md) for usage details.
