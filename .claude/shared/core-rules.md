# Core Rules for Agents

## Context Management

- Reference shared docs instead of duplicating information
- Summarize first, then provide details

## Output Rules

- Provide file size estimates for new files: "~200 lines, ~6KB"
- If output will be large, ask before creating: "This will be ~X lines. Should I split?"

## Code Generation

- Use imports/references over duplication
- Follow existing project patterns and conventions
- Create focused, single-responsibility modules
